##Testing
The application runs with one player, and can be started on the command line by navigating to the directory containing the scripts and running "python program.py team_name", where 'team_name' is the desired name of the team. You can run two separate instances in different command prompts and specifying a different name for the other team. The referee program requires its own prompt to start, and is run using the command "python referee.py team1 team2". In order for the players to participate in the game, 'team1' and 'team2' must be the same values passed as 'team_name'.

Currently, the game flow works only when the players are started and waiting for the referee to begin the game.
